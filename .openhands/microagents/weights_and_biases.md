## Querying Weave Data
Weave data is stored in traces, which often have relevant information stored in child calls. You might be able to query for a trace/op name directly but other times you might need to traverse the tree of child calls to find the right op with the right data. Use the W&B documentation links above as well as the example code below to guide you on the correct api to use.


### How to Access Specific Calls in a Weave Trace

0. Filtering and Querying
Filtering Weave calls can be quite powerful, for example the following filter can be used to filter by op name. For example:

Filtering by Op Name "QueryEnhancer-call":

```python
 "filter": {"op_names": ["weave:///wandbot/wandbot-dev/op/QueryEnhancer-call:*"]},
```

Querying by logged value "logging":

```python
"query": {"$expr":{"$contains":{"input":{"$getField":"inputs.inputs.query"},"substr":{"$literal":"logging"}}}},
```

Querying based on timestamp, after "12:00am January 14th, 2024" and before "12:00am January 16th 2024":

```python
 "query": {"$expr":{"$and":[{"$gt":[{"$getField":"started_at"},{"$literal":1736809200}]},{"$not":[{"$gt":[{"$getField":"started_at"},{"$literal":1736982000}]}]}]}},
```



2. Get a Parent Trace
   - Use calls_query or calls_query_stream to get a root trace:
  
   ```python
   client = weave.init("project/name")
   parent_calls = client.server.calls_query({
       "project_id": "project/name",
       "filter": {"trace_roots_only": True},  # Important: gets root traces only
       "query": {"$expr": {"$eq": [{"$getField": "your.filter.path"}, {"$literal": "your_value"}]}},
       "sort_by": [{"field": "started_at", "direction": "desc"}],
       "limit": 1  # Get just one trace to start
   })
   parent = parent_calls.calls[0]  # Get the first parent trace
   ```

3. Navigate the Trace Tree
   - Get a call object using the client.get_call() method
   - Use the children() method to traverse down the tree:

   ```python
   call_obj = client.get_call(call_id=parent.id)
   children = call_obj.children()
   ```

4. Search Through Children
   - Iterate through children and look for your target operation:
  
   ```
   for child in children:
       print(f"Operation: {child.op_name}")  # See what operations are available
       if "YourTargetOperation" in child.op_name:
           # Found it!
           target_call = child
   ```
           
5. Access Nested Children
   - Remember calls can have multiple levels - you may need to go deeper:
  
   ```
   for child in call_obj.children():
       child_obj = client.get_call(call_id=child.id)
       for grandchild in child_obj.children():
           if "YourTargetOperation" in grandchild.op_name:
               # Found it at level 2!
               target_call = grandchild
   ```

6. Access Call Data
   - Once you find your target call, access its data:
   - Inputs: target_call.inputs
   - Outputs: target_call.output
   - Metadata: target_call.started_at, target_call.id, etc.

Key Points:
- Don't filter too early - get the full trace tree first, then search within it
- Use `client.get_call()` and `.children()` to navigate the tree
- Check op_name to identify specific operations
- Be prepared to go multiple levels deep in the tree
- Remember calls are hierarchical: parent -> children -> grandchildren etc.


### Using Weave links
If the users provides you with a URL to a Weave project or trace, navigate to that link to help understand the request and the trace name or id being referred to as well as any of the relevant inputs, metadata or outputs to the conversation. If you are stuck and unable to find the correct data via the api you can ask the user to pass you a URL link to an example trace, from which you can extract useful information from the image.


## Results Management

Always offer to save analysis results or visualizations to W&B Reports.
Use the `wandb-workspaces` Python library for W&B Reports management.
Follow the W&B Reports documentation at https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/reports/ for:

- Creating new reports
- Editing existing reports
- Cloning reports
- Other report management tasks

Use the code examples from the W&B SDK tab in the documentation

## Error Handling
If repeatedly encountering errors using the `wandb` or `weave` api, make sure to search the documentation links provided above as well as doing a general internet search to help resolve the issue.

## Core Guidelines:

- Always verify that weave is installed before beginning to use the library
- Keep responses focused and concise while maintaining completeness
- Ensure proper Weights & Biases authentication before accessing any data
- Consider both technical audiences (ML engineers and software developers)
- Always offer options to save and share results to Weigths & Biases Reports
- Regularly reference the Weights & Biase documentation
