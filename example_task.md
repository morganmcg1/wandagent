here is code to download weave traces based on an evaluation run I did.

```python
import weave
assert weave.__version__ >= "0.50.14", "Please upgrade weave!" 

client = weave.init("wandbot/wandbot-dev")
calls = client.server.calls_query_stream({
   "project_id": "wandbot/wandbot-dev",
   "filter": {"trace_roots_only": True},
   "query": {"$expr":{"$eq":[{"$getField":"inputs.chat_request.application"},{"$literal":"wandbot-1-3_modified-query-enhancer-prompt"}]}},
   "sort_by": [{"field":"started_at","direction":"desc"}],
})
```


I want you to look at the list of queries in the `QueryEnhancer-call` call at `inputs.inputs.all_queries`, per query at `inputs.inputs.query`.

then i want you to analyse the quality of those generated queries, which are generated by a LLM based on the standalone_query.
